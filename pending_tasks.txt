Modular Layering:

Create clear separation between IBKR interface, strategy logic, and execution systems
Implement an abstraction layer so strategies don't directly communicate with IBKR but use higher-level functions


Performance Monitoring:

Implement metrics collectors that operate on separate threads
Use memory-mapped files for high-speed logging between processes


Error Handling & Recovery:

Add circuit breakers for strategies that are performing poorly
Implement automatic reconnection and state recovery for IBKR connections


Data Management:

Create a caching layer for market data to reduce redundant requests
Implement a database schema that's optimized for time-series data with proper indexing


Deployment & Configuration:

Use configuration files for strategy parameters
Create a validation system for configurations to catch errors before runtime


Strategy Development and Testing

Implement additional strategies in conventional and ML directories
Complete the ensemble strategy and LSTM predictor


Backtesting System

Finish the backtesting engine
Implement performance metrics calculation
Create parameter optimization with grid search


Data Pipeline Enhancement

Complete data cleaners and processors
Finalize database storage mechanisms
Ensure robust data fetching from IBKR


Monitoring System Integration

Test and integrate the monitoring components
Connect alert system with the trading engine
Complete the dashboard functionality


Comprehensive Testing

Expand unit tests for all components
Develop more integration tests for end-to-end workflows
Create test scenarios for edge cases


Documentation

Add docstrings to all modules and functions
Create comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
Document API interfaces and configuration options


Deployment Preparation

Complete the deployment scripts
Set up proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
Implement logging throughout the system


Performance Optimization

Profile the code for bottlenecks
Optimize critical paths for real-time trading
Implement thread management for concurrent operations
